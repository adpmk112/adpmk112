# Quick Introduction

I am a pragmatic and dedicated software developer with a serious focus on delivering clean and efficient code. My expertise lies in:

Java 🌟 – My primary and favorite language, ideal for deep learning and building robust applications.

Python 🐍 – My favorite dynamic language, excellent for data science tasks with tools like Pandas, and used for quick scripting.

C# 💻 – A substitutional language, used professionally as needed.
