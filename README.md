# Quick Introduction

I am a pragmatic and dedicated software developer with a strong focus on mastering foundational programming languages and understanding the core principles of software development. My expertise lies in delivering clean and efficient code, with a deep dive into the underlying mechanisms of languages and tools. I prioritize understanding the logic and solving problems at their core, and I believe in thoroughly reading documentation and books over simply practicing code.

Java 🌟 – My primary and favorite language, ideal for deep learning and building robust applications.

Python 🐍 – My favorite dynamic language, excellent for data science tasks with tools like Pandas, and used for quick scripting.

C# 💻 – A substitutional language, used professionally as needed.
